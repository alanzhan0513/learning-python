`'hello'` is the same as `"hello"`.

# Assign String to a Variable

``` python
x = "hello"
```

# Multiline Strings

``` python
a = """
Hello!
I am learning Python.
"""
```

Also, you can use `'`.

``` python
b = '''
Hello!
I am learning Python.
'''
```

# Strings are Arrays

``` python
a = "Hello!"
print(a[1]) # It will print 'e'.
```

# Slicing

``` python
b = "Hello!"
print(b[2,3]) # ll
```

# Slicing With Negative Indexing

``` python
c = "Hello!"
print(c[-3:-4]) # ll
```

# String Length

``` python
len("qq")
```
